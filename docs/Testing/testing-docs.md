# Testing Structure Overview

This document outlines our testing organization, types of tests, and best practices for maintaining test coverage.

## Directory Organization

```

├── core/                  # Core functionality tests
├── development/          # Development-specific tests
├── integration/         # Integration tests
├── services/           # Service-specific tests
├── unit/              # Unit tests
└── various test files at root level
```

## Types of Tests

### Unit Tests (`/unit/`)

Unit tests are focused on testing individual components in isolation. They are the fastest to run and are essential for testing single functions or classes.

Example:
```python
def test_get_user_success():
    user_service = UserService()
    result = user_service.get_user(id=123)
    assert result.name == "Expected Name"
```

### Integration Tests (`/integration/`)

Integration tests verify how different components work together. They are slower than unit tests but crucial for ensuring system cohesion.

Key characteristics:
- Tests interactions between multiple services
- Verifies database operations
- Ensures proper API communication

Example:
```python
def test_user_creation_with_database():
    user_service = UserService()
    database = Database()
    user = user_service.create_user({"name": "Test"})
    saved_user = database.get_user(user.id)
    assert saved_user == user
```

### Core Tests (`/core/`)

Core tests focus on fundamental functionality that other components depend on. These tests ensure the stability of essential features.

Example uses:
- Testing basic database connectivity
- Verifying authentication systems
- Testing core utility functions

### Service Tests (`/services/`)

Service tests are organized by specific service (e.g., Supabase, Google Drive) and contain service-specific test cases. These tests verify that each service operates correctly in isolation and handles edge cases appropriately.

### Development Tests (`/development/`)

Development tests are specific to the development environment and may include:
- Temporary test cases
- Experimental features
- Development-only functionality
- Environment-specific configurations

## Test Coverage

Test coverage metrics help identify areas of code that need additional testing:
- Aim for high coverage in critical paths
- Monitor coverage trends over time
- Prioritize testing of complex functionality

## Best Practices

1. Test Organization
   - Keep related tests together
   - Use clear, descriptive test names
   - Follow consistent file naming conventions

2. Test Execution
   - Run unit tests frequently during development
   - Include integration tests in CI/CD pipelines
   - Use appropriate test environments

3. Test Maintenance
   - Regular review and cleanup of tests
   - Update tests when functionality changes
   - Remove obsolete tests

## Example Test File Structure

```python
# backend/tests/unit/test_supabase_service.py

def test_get_user_success():
    # Arrange: Set up test conditions
    service = SupabaseService()
    
    # Act: Perform the test
    result = service.get_user(id=1)
    
    # Assert: Check the results
    assert result is not None
    assert result.id == 1
```

This example follows the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern and demonstrates clear test structure and assertions.
