# Template for Requesting Scientific Manuscript Revisions

## Overview
This template provides a structured format for requesting manuscript revisions that will yield comprehensive, actionable feedback and specific improvements to scientific writing.

## Basic Structure

```markdown
You are tasked with helping revise a science journal article about [TOPIC] to increase its chances of publication. Your job is to assess each section of the article, identify its strengths and weaknesses, provide recommendations for improvement, and then rewrite the section based on those recommendations.

Here is the content of the section you will be working on:

<article_section>
[PASTE SECTION CONTENT HERE]
</article_section>

This section is the [SECTION NAME] of the article.

Please follow these steps:

1. Carefully read and analyze the section.

2. In <analysis> tags, provide a brief assessment of the section's strengths and weaknesses. Focus more on the weaknesses, as these are areas for improvement.

3. In <recommendations> tags, offer specific suggestions for improving the section. These should address the weaknesses you identified and any other areas where the section could be strengthened to increase the likelihood of publication.

4. In <rewritten_section> tags, provide a rewritten version of the section that incorporates your recommendations. This should be a complete, polished version ready to be integrated into the revised article.
```

## Guidelines for Use

### Before Submitting
1. Clearly identify the manuscript section being revised
2. Ensure the section content is complete
3. Note any specific concerns or areas needing attention
4. Include relevant context about the target journal if available
5. Mention any style guide requirements

### What to Include

#### Background Information
- Article topic and field
- Target journal
- Section being revised
- Any relevant style guides or formatting requirements

#### Context
- Relationship to other sections
- Key messages to preserve
- Target audience
- Publication requirements

#### Special Requirements
- Word count limits
- Citation style
- Formatting specifications
- Figure/table requirements

## Example Usage

```markdown
You are tasked with helping revise a science journal article about cellular mechanisms of neurodegeneration to increase its chances of publication in Nature Neuroscience. Your job is to assess the Methods section, identify its strengths and weaknesses, provide recommendations for improvement, and then rewrite the section based on those recommendations.

<article_section>
[Methods section content...]
</article_section>

This section is the Methods section of the article. The target journal requires:
- Maximum 3,000 words for methods
- Vancouver citation style
- All procedures must include statistical analysis methods
- Animal protocols must include ethical approval details
```

## Best Practices

### Do:
1. Provide complete sections for review
2. Include relevant context
3. Specify any formatting requirements
4. Note word count limits
5. Mention target journal preferences
6. Include citation style requirements
7. Specify any field-specific conventions
8. Note required vs. optional changes

### Don't:
1. Submit incomplete sections
2. Omit crucial context
3. Mix multiple sections
4. Forget to specify the target journal
5. Ignore formatting requirements
6. Skip citation style information
7. Leave out word count limits
8. Neglect to mention special requirements

## Additional Considerations

### Style Guidelines
- Note any journal-specific style requirements
- Mention field-specific conventions
- Include formatting specifications
- Detail citation preferences

### Technical Requirements
- Word count limits
- Figure specifications
- Table formatting
- Supplementary material guidelines
- Data availability statements
- Code sharing requirements

### Special Elements
- Statistical reporting requirements
- Ethics statements
- Conflict of interest declarations
- Author contribution statements
- Funding information

## Follow-up Questions

After receiving the revision, consider asking:
1. Are there specific areas that need further improvement?
2. How can the changes be better aligned with journal requirements?
3. Are there additional style elements to consider?
4. Would supplementary materials be beneficial?
5. Are there opportunities for enhancing visual elements?

## Revision Tracking

Maintain a record of:
1. Original section content
2. Identified strengths and weaknesses
3. Implemented changes
4. Reasoning behind major revisions
5. Outstanding items for future revision

This template will help ensure thorough, systematic revisions that enhance the manuscript's chances of publication while maintaining its scientific integrity and key messages.
