# Introduction

Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC), also known as Post Covid-19 Syndrome (PC19S), has emerged as a significant public health challenge affecting an estimated 10-30% of individuals following acute SARS-CoV-2 infection [1]. This condition represents a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors that can persist for months or years after initial infection [2]. Despite its substantial impact on global health and healthcare systems, comprehensive treatment approaches remain limited.

PC19S is defined as the persistence or development of symptoms beyond 12 weeks from initial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with symptoms that cannot be explained by an alternative diagnosis [3]. The syndrome presents with a heterogeneous array of symptoms affecting multiple organ systems, often fluctuating in severity over time.

This article addresses critical gaps in current PC19S management by proposing an evidence-based, comprehensive treatment framework to enhance rehabilitation and recovery outcomes. Our approach integrates emerging pathophysiological understanding with clinical experience to provide practical guidance for healthcare providers.

Common symptoms associated with PC19S can be categorized by organ system:

## Cardiopulmonary
- Shortness of breath (reported in 40-50% of cases)
- Persistent cough
- Rapid or irregular heart rate
- Exercise intolerance

## Neurological
- Brain fog (cognitive dysfunction)
- Headaches
- Numbness and tingling
- Loss of taste and smell

## Constitutional
- Fatigue (reported in 50-70% of cases)
- Weakness
- Poor appetite
- Dizziness

## Gastrointestinal
- Nausea
- Loose stools
- Appetite changes

## Psychological
- Anxiety
- Depression
- Insomnia

## Other Systems
- Rashes
- Kidney impairment
- Musculoskeletal pain
- Metabolic dysregulation (including elevated blood glucose)

These symptoms may present in varying combinations and severities, with fatigue, cognitive dysfunction, and cardiopulmonary symptoms being among the most frequently reported [4]. Importantly, symptom patterns often fluctuate over time and may be exacerbated by physical or cognitive exertion.
