## Long Context Best Practices

Claude's extended context window (200K tokens for Claude 3 models) enables handling complex, data-rich tasks. Here are essential tips for optimizing long context prompts:

### Document Organization
- Place long documents and inputs (~20K+ tokens) near the top of your prompt
- Put queries and instructions after the documents
- Structure content with XML tags for clarity

Example:
```xml
<documents>
  <document index="1">
    <source>annual_report_2023.pdf</source>
    <document_content>
      [Annual Report Content]
    </document_content>
  </document>
  <document index="2">
    <source>competitor_analysis_q2.xlsx</source>
    <document_content>
      [Competitor Analysis Content]
    </document_content>
  </document>
</documents>

Analyze the annual report and competitor analysis. Identify strategic advantages and recommend Q3 focus areas.
```

### Grounding and Citation
- Ask Claude to quote relevant parts before analysis
- Use XML tags to structure quotes and analysis
- Reference specific sections of documents

Example:
```xml
<task>
Find relevant quotes about patient symptoms and provide analysis.
</task>

<quotes>
From patient_records.txt: "Patient reports intermittent chest pain lasting 5-10 minutes"
From patient_symptoms.txt: "Shortness of breath when climbing stairs"
</quotes>

<analysis>
Based on these symptoms...
</analysis>
```

## Text Generation Capabilities

Claude excels at various text-based tasks including:

### Core Capabilities
- **Text Summarization**: Create concise summaries of long documents
- **Content Generation**: Write blog posts, emails, marketing copy
- **Data Extraction**: Pull structured information from unstructured text
- **Question Answering**: Build interactive knowledge systems
- **Text Analysis**: Analyze sentiment and patterns
- **Code Generation**: Create and explain code
- **Translation**: Convert text between languages
- **Dialogue**: Engage in contextual conversations

### Best Practices for Text Generation
1. Provide clear context and objectives
2. Specify format and style requirements
3. Include examples when possible
4. Use structured prompts with XML tags
5. Break complex tasks into smaller steps

Example:
```plaintext
Write a blog post about artificial intelligence with these specifications:
- Target audience: Tech-savvy professionals
- Length: 800-1000 words
- Style: Informative but conversational
- Include: 3 real-world examples
- Structure: Introduction, 3 main points, conclusion
- Keywords: machine learning, neural networks, deep learning
```
