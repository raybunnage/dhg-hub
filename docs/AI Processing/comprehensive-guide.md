## Core Principles

### Clear and Direct Communication
- Treat interactions with Claude like working with a brilliant but new employee who needs explicit context
- Provide contextual information about:
  - Task purpose and end goals
  - Target audience
  - Workflow context
  - Success criteria
- Use sequential steps and specific instructions

#### Example: Unclear vs Clear Prompting

❌ Unclear Prompt:
```plaintext
Write marketing copy for our product.
```

✅ Clear Prompt:
```plaintext
Write marketing copy for our enterprise SaaS product with these specifications:
- Target audience: IT managers at Fortune 500 companies
- Key features to highlight: AI-powered security, real-time collaboration, compliance tools
- Tone: Professional but approachable
- Length: 200-250 words
- Include: One customer quote and a clear call-to-action
- Purpose: For use in email campaigns targeting existing leads
```

## Using XML Tags

XML tags are a powerful way to structure your prompts and help Claude parse different components more accurately.

### Benefits of XML Tags
- Clarity: Clear separation of different prompt parts
- Accuracy: Reduced misinterpretation errors
- Flexibility: Easy to modify specific sections
- Parseability: Easier to extract specific parts of responses

### Best Practices
- Be consistent with tag names throughout prompts
- Nest tags for hierarchical content
- Use meaningful tag names
- Combine with other techniques like multishot prompting or chain of thought

Example:
```xml
<context>
You are analyzing a financial report for Q2 2024.
</context>

<data>
Revenue: $1.2M
Growth: 15% YoY
Profit margin: 22%
</data>

<instructions>
1. Identify key trends
2. Flag any concerns
3. Recommend actions
</instructions>
```

## Role Prompting

Role prompting is a powerful technique to enhance Claude's performance by giving it a specific role or persona.

### Benefits
- Enhanced accuracy in domain-specific tasks
- Tailored communication style
- Improved focus on task requirements

Example:
```python
import anthropic

client = anthropic.Anthropic()
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=2048,
    system="You are a seasoned data scientist at a Fortune 500 company.",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Analyze this dataset for anomalies..."}
    ]
)
```

## Chain of Thought & Prompt Chaining

### Chain of Thought
CoT is particularly effective for:
- Complex mathematical calculations
- Multi-step analysis
- Decision-making with multiple factors
- Logic puzzles
- Document analysis

### Prompt Chaining
Breaking complex tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks:
1. Identify distinct steps
2. Structure with XML for clear handoffs
3. Focus each subtask on a single goal
4. Iterate and refine based on performance

Example of a chained workflow:
```plaintext
Step 1: Data Analysis
<data_analysis>
Analyze raw data and identify patterns
</data_analysis>

Step 2: Insight Generation
<insights>
Generate insights based on analysis
</insights>

Step 3: Recommendations
<recommendations>
Create actionable recommendations
</recommendations>
```

## Multishot Prompting

Providing multiple examples helps Claude understand patterns and expected outputs.

### Best Practices
- Include 3-5 diverse examples
- Cover edge cases
- Use consistent structure
- More examples generally lead to better performance

Example:
```xml
<examples>
<example>
Input: Return policy question
Response: Our standard return window is 30 days...
Category: Policy
</example>

<example>
Input: Product defect
Response: I'm sorry to hear about the defect...
Category: Support
</example>
</examples>
```

## Prefilling Responses

Prefilling Claude's responses can help control output format and skip unnecessary preambles.

### Benefits
- Direct output formatting
- Skip preambles
- Enforce specific structures
- Maintain consistency

Example:
```python
response = client.messages.create(
    model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
    max_tokens=1024,
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Extract data as JSON"},
        {"role": "assistant", "content": "{"}  # Forces JSON output
    ]
)
```

## Evaluation Guidelines

### Success Criteria Framework
```plaintext
1. Response Accuracy
   - % correct information
   - % false information
   - Compliance rate

2. Response Time
   - Average response time
   - Maximum response time

3. Quality Metrics
   - Grammar score
   - Tone alignment
   - Brand voice compliance
```

### Testing Strategies
- A/B testing different prompts
- Edge case testing
- Performance monitoring
- User satisfaction metrics

## Best Practices for Production

### Error Handling
- Implement retry logic
- Set up monitoring
- Create fallback responses
- Log and analyze errors

### Performance Optimization
- Cache common responses
- Batch similar requests
- Implement response streaming
- Use efficient token management

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- Track key metrics
- Regular prompt refinement
- A/B testing
- Continuous evaluation
