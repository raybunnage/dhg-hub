## For New Developers
This project is designed for intermediate developers looking to expand their full-stack development skills. Key areas to focus on:

1. **Backend Development**
   - Understanding FastAPI and Python class-based architecture
   - Working with type hints and abstract classes
   - Implementing service integrations
   - Writing and maintaining tests

2. **Frontend Development**
   - React component architecture
   - State management
   - API integration
   - Modern JavaScript/TypeScript practices

3. **Document Processing**
   - PDF handling and text extraction
   - Document storage and retrieval
   - Search and categorization

4. **Database Management**
   - Supabase operations
   - Data modeling
   - Query optimization

## Next Steps
- Review the documentation structure
- Set up your local development environment
- Familiarize yourself with the codebase organization
- Start with small features or bug fixes to understand the workflow

More detailed documentation for each component will be added as the project evolves.

## Using Templates with Cursor AI

Templates in web development typically refer to reusable HTML/component structures. With Cursor AI, you can generate templates in different ways depending on your framework (React, Vue, etc.).

### Generating Templates

#### Basic Approach
Ask Cursor something like:

typescript
"Generate a template for a user profile card component in React"

#### More Specific Requests
You can be more detailed with requests like:
- "Create a TypeScript React template for a data table with sorting and filtering"
- "Generate a form template with Zod validation"

### Example Template

Here's an example of what Cursor might generate:

typescript
interface ProfileCardProps {
name: string;
email: string;
avatar?: string;
}
const ProfileCard: React.FC<ProfileCardProps> = ({ name, email, avatar }) => {
return (
<div className="card">
{avatar && <img src={avatar} alt={${name}'s avatar} />}
<h2>{name}</h2>
<p>{email}</p>
</div>
);
};


### Best Practices for Template Generation

#### Be specific about:
- Framework (React, Vue, etc.)
- TypeScript/JavaScript
- Styling approach (CSS, Tailwind, etc.)
- Validation requirements
- Props/data structure

#### Ask for:
- Type definitions
- Props interface
- Basic styling
- Common functionality

### Common Template Types
- Forms
- Cards
- Lists
- Tables
- Layouts
- Navigation components

> **Remember:** Templates generated by AI are starting points - you'll likely need to customize them for your specific needs.
